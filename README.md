Hi, my name is Vinay Bhupathiraju and I am a recent grad from UC San Diego with a degree in Quantitative Economics and a minor in Data Science. I am eager to learn more about Machine Learning and am looking for full-time opportunities in the space. I have uploaded files from some Data Science courses I took, work assignments I completed, as well as personal projects to display my experience.
